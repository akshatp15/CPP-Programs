# C++ Programs
<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that demonstrate core language concepts such as arrays, functions, and input/output (I/O). It is designed for project-based learning, where each program introduces and builds upon key C++ concepts. As you progress through the projects, you'll gradually develop a solid foundation in C++ while exploring more advanced topics.

<h2>C++ Setup and Installation</h2>
To view/edit the programs or to be able to create new C++ programs you will need a text editor. I would recommend downloading VSCode as it is easy to use, but you can use notepad or any other text editor which you are comfortable with.<br>
To install VSCode please follow the instruction at the following link, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download"> Downloading VSCode</a>.
<h3>C++ Compiler</h3>
To be able to run any of the programs in this repository you will need to download a C++ compiler. To do so please follow the instructions in the links below for your specific operating system.
<li>Windows: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw"> C++ compiler for Windows</a></li>
<li>Linux: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux"> C++ compiler for Linux</a></li>
<li>MacOS: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac"> C++ compiler for Mac</a></li>

<h2>Program Descriptions</h2>
<h3>Calculator</h3>
<li>This program is a basic calculator which does addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with 2 numbers. This program shows how to work with standard output and input, arithemtic operations, handling invalid user inputs, and switches in C++.</li>
<h3>Credit Card Number Validator</h3>
<li>This program is checks if a credit card number is valid. To do this we can use Luhn's Algorithm which is described in detail inside this program and this program shows how to work with for loops, modulus operator, strings, and functions.</li>
<h3>Number Guessing Game</h3>
<li>This program is a number guessing game where the user gets 5 chances to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. This program shows how to work with for while loops, standard output and input, and randomly generating integers using the rand() function. </li>
<h3>Quiz Game</h3>
<li>This program is a quiz game where the user tries to answer 4 multiple choice questions correctly. This program shows how to work with 1D arrays, 2D arrays, and for loops. </li>
<h3>Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
<li>This program is a Rock Paper Scissors game where the user tries beat the computer. This program shows how to work with functions, while loops, logical operators, switches, rand() function, and standard input and output.</li>
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<li>This program is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user tries beat the computer. This program shows how to work with arrays, functions, while and for loops, logical operators, ternary operators, rand() function, and standard input and output.</li>
